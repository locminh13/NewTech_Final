## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Color: Lime Zest (#4CAF50). Instead of the vibrant green (#6acc6c), this slightly deeper and richer green still conveys freshness and growth but feels more dynamic and modern. Itâ€™s bold yet grounded, perfect for the fruit industry.
- Background Color: Crisp White (#FFFFFF) with a subtle hint of Cool Grey (#ECEFF1). Replace the light grey (#f0f2f0) with pure white as the primary background for a cleaner, brighter, and more vibrant look. Use the cool grey as a secondary background for sections or cards to add depth while keeping the professional feel.
- Accent Color: Tangerine Glow (#FF7043). Swap the yellow-orange (#ffbb33) for a vivid tangerine. This warm, juicy hue is more striking and aligns better with the vibrant energy of fruits like oranges and mangoes. It pops against the primary green and white background, drawing attention to key elements like calls to action.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for readability.
- Use fruit-themed icons to represent different transaction types and data points.
- Dashboard-style layout with clear sections for market data, risk assessment, and transaction details.
